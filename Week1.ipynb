    " 2. What variables did you select for further inspection? Why do you think they will be useful? You may support any argument with a visualization.\n",
    " 3. List any insight you gained by looking at the data visualization or any other data analysis that you perform.\n",
    " 4. List 3-5 hypothesis about which variables will be important for analysis, and how they will affect the outcome.\n",
